We chose to investigate two pre-installed dataframes on R: **"Student's Sleep Data"** and **"UK Driver Deaths"**. 

Sleep.R contains the commands to source "Student's Sleep Data", to describe the central tendency and variance of it main variable - extra	 numeric	 increase in hours of sleep, to visualize the difference between control group and experiment group using boxplot, and to source UKDriverDeaths.R.

UKDriverDeaths.R contains the commands to source "UK Driver Deaths", to describe the central tendency and variance of number of deaths and percentage of deaths, and to compare the fluctutions of the two variables using line charts.
